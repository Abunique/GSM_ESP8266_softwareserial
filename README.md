# GSM_ESP8266_softwareserial
Functionality - to initiate and use software serial to send AT commands from serial monitor and to fetch the outcome and display the same without using any special library for the function. I have used softwareserial.h library and working on even removing the same in further upgradations.
Framework - Arduino
